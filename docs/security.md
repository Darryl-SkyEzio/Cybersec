# Security Guidelines

## Overview
This document outlines security best practices implemented in the Cybersec project and guidelines for maintaining security throughout development.

## Implemented Security Measures

### Backend Security
- **Helmet.js** - Sets various HTTP headers to help protect against common vulnerabilities
- **CORS Configuration** - Properly configured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- **Rate Limiting** - Protection against brute force and DoS attacks
- **Input Validation** - Request validation using express-validator
- **Error Handling** - Secure error messages that don't leak sensitive information

### Frontend Security
- **CSP Headers** - Content Security Policy to prevent XSS attacks
- **Input Sanitization** - All user inputs are sanitized before processing
- **Secure Storage** - No sensitive data stored in localStorage or sessionStorage
- **HTTPS Only** - Enforced in production environments

## Security Checklist

### Development Phase
- [ ] All dependencies are up to date and security-scanned
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials in code
- [ ] Environment variables used for all configuration
- [ ] Input validation on all user inputs
- [ ] Proper error handling without information disclosure
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Authentication and authorization properly implemented

### Testing Phase
- [ ] Security vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Penetration testing
- [ ] Input validation testing
- [ ] Authentication bypass testing
- [ ] Authorization testing
- [ ] Session management testing

### Deployment Phase
- [ ] HTTPS configured and enforced
- [ ] Security headers verified
- [ ] Database security configured
- [ ] Monitoring and logging enabled
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures in place
- [ ] Incident response plan ready

## Common Vulnerabilities and Prevention

### 1. SQL Injection
**Prevention:**
- Use parameterized queries
- Input validation and sanitization
- Principle of least privilege for database access

### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
**Prevention:**
- Input sanitization
- Output encoding
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- HttpOnly cookies

### 3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Prevention:**
- CSRF tokens
- SameSite cookie attribute
- Proper CORS configuration

### 4. Authentication Vulnerabilities
**Prevention:**
- Strong password policies
- Multi-factor authentication
- Session timeout
- Secure password storage (bcrypt)

### 5. Insecure Direct Object References
**Prevention:**
- Access control checks
- Object-level authorization
- Principle of least privilege

## Security Headers

### Implemented Headers
```javascript
{
  "Content-Security-Policy": "default-src 'self'",
  "X-Content-Type-Options": "nosniff",
  "X-Frame-Options": "DENY",
  "X-XSS-Protection": "1; mode=block",
  "Strict-Transport-Security": "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains",
  "Referrer-Policy": "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
}
```

## Secure Development Guidelines

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials
- [ ] Proper input validation
- [ ] Secure error handling
- [ ] Authentication checks
- [ ] Authorization verification
- [ ] Logging of security events

### Dependency Management
- Regular dependency updates
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Use of trusted packages only
- Lock file management

### Environment Configuration
- Separate configurations for dev/staging/production
- Secure secret management
- Environment variable validation
- Configuration encryption for sensitive data

## Incident Response

### Detection
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity
- Set up alerts for security events
- Regular security scans

### Response
1. Identify and contain the threat
2. Assess the impact
3. Notify stakeholders
4. Document the incident
5. Implement fixes
6. Learn and improve

## Compliance and Standards

### Frameworks
- OWASP Top 10
